    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I (the person who made it, not me lol) have a peanut butter pancake recipe that I modify from time to time. This one tastes fantastic with warm maple or strawberry syrup. I freeze leftover pancakes and reheat them in the toaster, spreading them with strawberry or raspberry jam. Yum!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ripe banana, mashed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle over medium heat</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Combine milk, mashed banana, peanut butter, egg, oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and whisk until batter is thoroughly mixed.</li>
        <li>Ladle batter in 1/4 cup portions onto the preheated griddle and cook until tiny air bubbles form on the top, 2 to 5 minutes; flip and continue cooking until the bottoms are browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pancakes to a plate and cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.
